    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <h2>Installing Americons</h2>
    <p>
        You can get Americons via the releases page on
        <a href="https://github.com/bowmanmc/americons/releases">GitHub</a> or via NPM:
        <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save americons</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Our releases are packaged with the following contents:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>css</strong> - The CSS for Americons (generated from the sass source).</li>
        <li><strong>fonts</strong> - The fonts used for Americons.</li>
        <li><strong>sass</strong> - The sass source code for Americons (you can use this instead of the compiled CSS if you prefer).</li>
        <li><strong>svg</strong> - SVG files used to generate the icon fonts. More info on how this folder is organized is below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using Americons</h2>
    <p>
        The easiest way is to copy the Americons folder to the root of your
        web application and include the minified CSS file in your HTML file.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would rather use the Sass files, make sure the americons font
        files end up in a folder named "fonts" next to the folder containing
        your compiled CSS.
    </p>

    <h2>SVG Options</h2>
    <p>
        If you would rather just use the SVG files directly instead of the icon
        fonts, look in the SVG directory. The SVG files in the icons folder are
        the ones used in the icon fonts. They have been processed using SVGO and
        are ready for you to include in your projects and style however you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also included a folder named states that contains three separate
        SVG files for each state with varying resolutions. The low resolution
        files are smaller but have less detail. The high resolution files are
        larger and more complex, with much more detail. The medium ones are
        in between. For more information on how these files were generated,
        see the companion project
        <a href="https://github.com/bowmanmc/americons-geo">americons-geo</a>.
        The best one to use will depend on the size you plan on rendering
        them at.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, here is the state of Ohio at a low resolution:
        <br />
        <svg class="ohio-ex-large"><use xlink:href="#ohsmall" /></svg>
        <br />
        oh-low.svg (size: 3kb)
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the state of Ohio at a high resolution:
        <br />
        <svg class="ohio-ex-large"><use xlink:href="#ohlarge" /></svg>
        <br />
        oh-hi.svg (size: 27kb)
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, there's much more detail in the high resolution file
        along the Ohio river and Lake Erie. But the file size is also 9x larger.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now here are the same two files at 32x32 pixels:
        <br />
        <svg class="ohio-ex-small"><use xlink:href="#ohsmall" /></svg>
        <br />
        oh-low.svg (size: 3kb)
        <br />
        <svg class="ohio-ex-small"><use xlink:href="#ohlarge" /></svg>
        <br />
        oh-hi.svg (size: 27kb)
    </p>
    <p>
        At this resolution, the differences are much harder to spot, however the
        low resolution file is smaller and easier for the browser to render quickly.
    </p>

    <h2>SVG use tag</h2>
    <p>
        There is a symbols folder in the svg directory that has a text file for
        each state containing an svg symbol definition.
        To use these, you'll first need to inject an svg block into your markup
        containing a defs block with the symbols you want to use. Then you can
        use them anywhere in your page with something like:
        <pre><code class="language-html">
            &lt;svg class="some-custom-class"&gt;
                &lt;use xlink:href="#am-oh" /&gt;
            &lt;/svg&gt;
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        For an example of how to do this, look at the source code for this page.
        You'll see the the ohsmall and ohlarge symbols in the hidden SVG at the top of the file.
